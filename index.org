* What's going on?

** Attacks are evolving

   * More attacks
   * More advanced attacks
   * More visible attacks

** Attack visibility

   "Oh, well, you got lucky an attack /just/ happened"

   Heartland, TJX, RSA, Gawker, Verisign, Target, Sony, Snowden
   leaks, Heartbleed, Sony some more, OPM...

** Why are attacks more prevalent?

** A lot of our technology is insecure

   * Implicitly trust the network
   * Focused on making it work
   * Not concerned with security
   * TCP, SMTP, DNS...

** More information

   * /Many/ more services, store lots of data
   * Side effect of commodity cloud computing?
   * PII, payment information, customer data, intellectual property...
   * If you made money with it, odds are so can an attacker

** Fundamentally just market economics

   If revenue > cost, someone is going to do it

** Defense hasn't evolved

   * At least not for most people
   * ~fail2ban~, ~snort~...

** Defense /has/ evolved

   * Tons of vendors (RSA Conference?)
   * Examining options is a full-time job

** Increasing demands

   * Modern apps are increasingly complex

** Increasing cost of tools

   * Effective monitoring requires 24x7x365 SOC
   * n dozen security analyst + licenses

** Decreasing resources

   * Modern apps are increasingly complex
   * Efforts should focus on your app, not security

** TL;DR

   * SME's don't have the resources
   * Larger enterprises have better things to do
   * Tools are less accessible

* What are we doing about it?

** Current portfolio

   * Active defense
   * Compliance assistance
   * Multi-factor auth & user management
   * Log management & analysis

** Active Defense

   * CSOC
   * Active detection
   * Threat intelligence
   * Patch management

** CSOC

   * 3 x 8 security analysts, 24 x 7 x 365

** SIEM

   * (Security information & event management)
   * Benefit of hosting provider scale:
     * Correlate across customers
     * Lots of internal network data

** Compliance assistance

   PCI-DSS, HIPPA

**

** Compliance

   * Compliance as a consequence of security
   * *Not* compliance for its own sake
   * "Teach the test"

* Thank you!

* Questions?
