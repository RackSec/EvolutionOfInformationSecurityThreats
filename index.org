* What's going on?

** Attacks are evolving

   * More attacks
   * More advanced
   * More visible

** APT

   Advanced Persistent Threat

   * Human-driven
   * Reactive and ongoing
   * Targeted

** Why are attacks more prevalent?

** More information

   * More services, lots of data
   * Huge success of cloud computing
   * PII, customer data, IP...

** Attacks have evolved

   * State-level funding
   * Robust exploit market
   * Market specialization
   * Revenue > cost, low risk

** The security poverty line

   * Most organizations can't afford security
   * Lack of specialized talent
   * Tons of vendors (RSA Conference?)
     * Examining options is a full-time job

** Increasing cost of defense

   * Effective monitoring is 24x7x365
   * /n/ analyst salaries, equipment, licenses

** TL;DR

   * SME's don't have the resources
   * All companies have better things to do
   * Tools are less accessible

* How are we helping?

** Current open source

   Rackspace created/sponsored:

   * PyCA (Python Cryptographic Authority)
   * ~pip~ TLS improvements
   * Python stdlib TLS improvements
   * ...

** Great, but not enough

   Doesn't help if:

   * your box is rooted,
   * your auth scheme is full of holes,
   * your TLS configuration is broken,
   * ...

   Security-as-a-service

   Backed by 24 x 7 x 365 CSOC

** CSOC

   Customer Security Operations Center

   3 x 8 security analysts, 24 x 7 x 365

** Analytics platform

   Benefit of hosting provider scale:

   * Correlate across customers
   * Lots of internal network data

** Compliance assistance

   PCI-DSS, HIPPA, ...

** Compliance

   * Compliance as a consequence of security
   * /Not/ "teach the test" compliance
   * Largely possible because specs are saner

* Thank you!
